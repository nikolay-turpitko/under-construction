This application is under construction ever and is not intended for public use.

This is a pure proof-of-concept application for our internal tests, debugging, development and research.

No public users are allowed except explicitly invited testers and developers.

If you found this application publicly avilable by mistake, please notify us and we'll take measures to hide or remove it.

For your safety do not install or use this application if you found it publicly avilable by mistake and if you were not invited as a tester.

We do not intentionally collect any user's private data with this application, even if it may sometimes appear like this.

We may use this application to test and learn UI or technologies, which we are going to use later in other applications.

So, sometimes we may test UI or technologies appearing as we're collecting some private data, but it should be fake test data and it will be removed after tests.

Once again, this application is for our own development / test needs only, please do not use it if you were not invited as a tester or developer.
